### Description: 

This project was my first attempt at C#. User loads application and types in a value. Depending on the value they put it will give them either a fail, pass, merit or distinction. I learnt how to user the Windows Form toolbox and drag items on the screen and then I learnt how to make them do different things. When I created this project, I didn’t have a design to follow but instead I quickly put something together and got it working.

I made this project in college and then submitted as part of my work which received the highest grade because I had a strong understand of how the interface works and how to change it. I did learn a lot of new techniques and I will list them down in the “What I Learnt” section.

### Prerequisites:
- Visual Studio 2019 (Recommended)
- Windows 10 (OS)

### Instructions:
- Step 1: Download Visual Studio (If you don't have already)
- Step 2: Clone this project
- Step 3: Once downloading is finished, open it up using Visual Studio
- Step 4: Click run at the top and the application will run
- Step 5: Input values into box and you will be given a score!


### Planned Features:
I wouldn't make any major changes to the interface but maybe I could add some unit tests. It would make it easier to test data rather than having to type in a value.

### What I Learnt:
- Windows Standard Form
- Variables
- Toolbox in Visual Studio

### Constraints:
None.

### Instrcutions:
User loads application and types in a value. Depending on the value they put it will give them either a fail, pass, merit or distinction
