### Description: 

This project was my first attempt at C#. I learnt how to user the Windows Form toolbox and drag items on the screen and then I learnt how to give them instructions. When I created this project, I didn’t have a design to follow but instead I quickly put something together and got it working.

I made this project in college and then submitted as part of my work which received the highest grade because I had a strong understand of how the interface works and how to change it. I did learn a lot of new techniques and I will list them down in the “What I Learnt” section.

### Planned Features:
I wouldn't make any major changes to the interface but maybe I could add some unit tests. It would make it easier to test data rather than having to type in a value.

### Constraints:
None.

### Instrcutions
User loads application and types in a value. Depending on the value they put it will give them either a fail, pass, merit or distinction

### Tools:
You will need the following software installed to be able to use the application:
- Visual Studio 2017+
