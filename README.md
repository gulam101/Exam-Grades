# Exam-Grades
Simple program that displays a message box depending on a grade that the user inputs.

This project was my first attempt at C#. I learnt how to user the Windows Form toolbox and drag items on the screen and then I learnt how to give them instructions.

I made this project in college and then submitted as part of my work which recieved the highest grade because I had a strong understand of how the interface works and how to change it.

I also played around with the interfaces and broke the code to understand why it broke and how to change in the near future.
