### Description: 

This project was my first attempt at C#. I learnt how to user the Windows Form toolbox and drag items on the screen and then I learnt how to give them instructions. When I created this project, I didn’t have a design to follow but instead I quickly put something together and got it working.

I made this project in college and then submitted as part of my work which received the highest grade because I had a strong understand of how the interface works and how to change it. I did learn a lot of new techniques and I will list them down in the “What I Learnt” section.

### Tools:
